# Pitch Grip Log

**Pitch Grip Log** is a web application designed for pitchers to document, share, and refine their pitching grips and techniques. It provides a structured way for pitchers to log their pitches, arm slots, and additional notes to improve their performance.

## Features

- **Add a New Grip**: Log details about specific pitches, including pitch type, handedness, arm slot, and text descriptions.
- **View and Manage Grips**: Review logged grips and manage them with options to edit or delete entries.
- **Organized Options**: Dropdown menus for pitch types, handedness, and arm slots ensure consistency and ease of use.
